The YouTube Sentiment Analysis Project involved the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiments expressed in user comments on YouTube videos. The primary objective was to gain insights into the overall sentiment trends of the audience, ranging from positive and neutral to negative, in response to the video content.The scope of the project encompassed a diverse range of YouTube content, allowing for the identification of patterns and sentiments specific to different genres or topics. The findings from the sentiment analysis were then visualized through interactive dashboards and reports, providing stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the audience's reactions.
